#   ./scripts/check-coverage.sh              # Local check (fails if uncovered without ignore)
#   ./scripts/check-coverage.sh --codecov    # Generate filtered coverage.out for Codecov
#
# Mark untestable code with: // coverage:ignore - <reason>
#
# The comment must be on the same line as the uncovered code, or the line before.
#
# Mark an ENTIRE file as exempt by placing a comment containing
#   coverage:ignore-file - <reason>
# anywhere in the file's first 20 lines.
